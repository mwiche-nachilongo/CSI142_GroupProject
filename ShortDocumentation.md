//The domain scenario in which this app is utilized is a store that provides organic products like fruit and meat. The class structures comprise of private fields that are attributes unique to each object like seasonality (fruit) and cut type (meat). The superclass of the constructor chain (that displays inheritance) is "Product". In the product constructor, fields like the string "name" and the double "weight" which are common to attributes of objects in each subclass, are initialized. The constructor in the subclass "Meat" initializes the unique string "cutType" while that in "Fruit" initializes the boolean field "isSeasonal". Both subclasses initialize the fields in the superclass before initializing each unique field by using the  "super" keyword and specifying each variable name. The sorting of objects (a feature of the app only visible to employees when the comamand java MainApp employee is entered in the console after compilation) is approached  using the "selectionSort" and "insertionSort" utility classes, two classes that implement the sort algorthim (
